PILCO evaluates and minimises the expected cost by cascading uncertain inputs through the GP dynamics model. This approach only allows PILCO to make decisions based on the total uncertainty on the cost. I use variance as a metric for uncertainty and employ the law of total variance to decompose the total cost uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic components. I introduce a gold-standard Monte-Carlo scheme to separately estimate each quantity by propagating trajectories through an approximation to PILCOâ€™s dynamics model. Finally, I show that when PILCO is learning efficiently it is selecting policies associated with a high ratio of epistemic cost uncertainty to total cost uncertainty.
